## Installing Python/Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You should, but if not, grab it from [python.org](https://python.org). 

Then, using the `pip3` package manager, run:

```
pip3 install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyterlab
```

After all those get installed, you should be ready to get started! In this folder, go ahead and run:

```
jupyter lab
```

The lab interface should open in your default browser, but if not, copy the URL from the terminal.

Happy Hacking!
